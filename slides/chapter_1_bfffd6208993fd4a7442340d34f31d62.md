## Advanced combinations of `group by` and case statements

`@script`
From your introductory SQL classes, you would remember the `group by` clause. 

We also discussed the use of `CASE` statements in previous lessons in this course. In this lesson, we will begin combining these statements to produce more advanced SQL queries!

## Recap of GROUP BY and CASE statements

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "c22cfee90c"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
### Group BY
```
SELECT student_gender, COUNT(*) 
FROM students
GROUP BY student_gender;
```{{1}}
### CASE
```
SELECT 
    student_name, 
    CASE WHEN score > 50 then 'pass' else 'fail' end as pass_fail
FROM students; 
```{{3}}


`@script`
To recap, the `group by` clause can be used to summarize data when used along with aggregate functions such as `count`.

Similarly, we can use CASE statements to perform if-else calculations on our data.

Lets now combine these two concepts!

## Gender distribution among social classes in the Titanic

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "33293bdf95"
```

`@part1`
```
SELECT pclass, name, sex FROM passengers;

 pclass |            name             |  sex   
--------+-----------------------------+--------
      3 | Pokrnic, Mr. Mate           | male
      3 | McNeill, Miss. Bridget      | female
      1 | Hilliard, Mr. Herbert Hen.. | male
      3 | Kink-Heilmann, Mr. Anton    | male
```
{{1}}
```
SELECT 
    pclass, sex, count(*) 
FROM passengers 
GROUP BY pclass, sex;
```
{{2}}
```
 pclass |  sex   | count 
--------+--------+-------
      3 | male   |   493
      1 | male   |   179
      2 | male   |   171
      3 | female |   216
      1 | female |   144
      2 | female |   106
```
{{3}}


`@script`
Lets say we have a table with the list of passengers that traveled in the ship Titanic, and we want to look at the number of male and female passengers in each socioeconomic class, which is provided in a column called "pclass". 

We could do that by writing a "group by" statement with the columns `pclass` and sex, along with a count aggregate function. 

However, you can see that the output data is not easy to analyze because of duplication of rows with the same value for each grouping column.

## Basic combination of group by and case statements

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "f4eed85772"
```

`@part1`
Desired output:
```
 pclass | males | females 
--------+-------+---------
      1 |   179 |     144
      2 |   171 |     106
      3 |   493 |     216
```

```
SELECT 
    pclass,

    SUM(CASE WHEN sex = 'male' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS males, 

    SUM(CASE WHEN sex = 'female' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS females 

FROM passengers GROUP BY pclass
```
{{1}}


`@script`
Now we shall try to obtain the same result pivoted to a more understandable representation.

We wish to obtain an output showing the number of males and females for each pclass value, as shown.

To produce this output, we can write a SELECT statement that includes two aggregate CASE statements columns. Here, in each aggregate CASE statement, we set a value of 1 if the particular person is of the required sex, and then we sum all these 1s together to get the total number of people of that sex within each group. This gives us our desired output above!

## Add more aggregate case columns

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "882053eaef"
```

`@part1`
Counts of people with siblings/spouses (sibsp):

```

SELECT pclass,
   SUM(CASE WHEN sex = 'male' THEN 1 else 0 END) AS males, 
   SUM(CASE WHEN sex = 'female' THEN 1 else 0 END) AS females,

   SUM(CASE WHEN sex = 'male' and sibsp = 0 THEN 1 else 0 END) 
      AS males_wo_sibsp,
   SUM(CASE WHEN sex = 'female' and sibsp = 0 THEN 1 else 0 END) 
      AS females_wo_sibsp 
 FROM passengers 
 GROUP BY pclass;
```

```
 pclass | males | females | males_with_sibsp | females_with_sibsp 
--------+-------+---------+------------------+--------------------
      1 |   179 |     144 |               56 |                 69
      2 |   171 |     106 |               49 |                 46
      3 |   493 |     216 |              109 |                 89

```
{{1}}


`@script`
We can similarly keep adding more descriptive columns with these case statements. Here, we also include two more SUM - CASE aggregate columns. These columns give information about the number of siblings/spouses each passenger had on the ship (coming from the column s-i-b-s-p).

## More arithmetic with grouped case statements

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "5802c3883d"
```

`@part1`
Calculating the average male and female age in each class:
```
SELECT pclass,

    AVG(CASE WHEN sex = 'male' THEN age else null END) 
    AS average_male_age,
 
    AVG(CASE WHEN sex = 'female' THEN age else null END) 
    AS average_female_age

 FROM passengers 
 GROUP BY pclass;
```
{{1}}
```
 pclass | average_male_age | average_female_age 
--------+------------------+--------------------
      1 | 41.0292715231788 |   37.0375939849624
      2 | 30.8153797468354 |   27.4992233009709
      3 | 25.9622636103152 |   22.1853289473684
```
{{2}}


`@script`
We can also perform more advanced arithmetic with these grouped case statements. Till now, we made the CASE statements just return 1 or 0 values. We can do more. 
For example, in the Titanic data, we also have access to the age of each passenger. How can we calculate the average age for male and female passengers in each "pclass"? 

We can apply the AVG function on the same CASE statements as before, while allowing it to return the "age" column. 

Note that these CASE statements will return NULL if the condition is not matched, and this will be ignored by the "AVG" aggregate function, allowing us to only average ages of a particular gender in each column.

## Combine counting with Grouped CASE statements

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "fc7c6236a2"
```

`@part1`
```
SELECT pclass, name, ticket, embarked 
FROM passengers order by ticket limit 5;

 pclass |            name             | ticket | embarked 
--------+-----------------------------+--------+----------
      1 | Maioni, Miss. Roberta       | 110152 | S
      1 | Rothes, the Countess. of .. | 110152 | S
      1 | Cherry, Miss. Gladys        | 110152 | S
      1 | Taussig, Mr. Emil           | 110413 | S
      1 | Taussig, Miss. Ruth         | 110413 | S
```
{{1}}
Can we find the number of unique tickets issued for each class at each embarked port?
{{2}}


`@script`
We can also combine the grouped case statements with counting functions. 

For example, we also have ticketing and port information about our Titanic passengers. Note also how multiple passengers have traveled under the same ticket number.
 
Now, given this information, can we find the number of unique tickets issued for each class at each embarked port?

Of course, we still want to display this complex table in an easy-to-digest fashion!

## Combine counting with Grouped CASE statements

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "00a607ff8f"
```

`@part1`
```
SELECT 
  pclass,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN embarked = 'S' THEN ticket END) AS tickets_s,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN embarked = 'C' THEN ticket END) AS tickets_c,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN embarked = 'Q' THEN ticket END) AS tickets_q
FROM passengers
GROUP BY pclass
```

```
 pclass | tickets_s | tickets_c | tickets_q 
--------+-----------+-----------+-----------
      1 |       112 |        76 |         1
      2 |       165 |        20 |         7
      3 |       375 |        75 |        99
```
{{2}}


`@script`
We can combine count, distinct, and case keywords, to count the number of distinct tickets issued at each embarked port, as shown here.

This will then provide the required output showing the distribution of tickets for each class. Interestingly, we quickly observe that 99 of 107 tickets issued in port Q were for people from the lowest socioeconomic class!

## Let's practice

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "506a176209"
```

`@script`
Now lets apply these aggregate case statements in practice to gain more experience on these concepts!
