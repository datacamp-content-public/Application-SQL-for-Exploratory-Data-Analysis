## Advanced combinations of `group by` and case statements

`@script`
From your introductory SQL classes, you would remember the `group by` clause. We also discussed the use of `CASE` statements in previous lessons in this course. In this lesson, we will begin combining these classes of statements to produce more advanced SQL queries!

## Recap of GROUP BY and CASE statements

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "c22cfee90c"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
### Group BY
```
SELECT student_gender, COUNT(*) 
FROM students
GROUP BY student_gender;
```{{1}}
### CASE
```
SELECT 
    student_name, 
    CASE WHEN score > 50 then 'pass' else 'fail' end as pass_fail
FROM students; 
```{{3}}


`@script`
From your introductory SQL classes, you would remember that the `group by` clause can be used to summarize data when used along with aggregate functions such as `count`.

Similarly, we can use case statements to perform if else calculations on our data an produce synthetic columns. 

Lets now combine these two concepts!

## Gender distribution among social classes in the Titanic

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "33293bdf95"
```

`@part1`
```
select pclass, name, sex from passengers;

 pclass |            name             |  sex   
--------+-----------------------------+--------
      3 | Pokrnic, Mr. Mate           | male
      3 | McNeill, Miss. Bridget      | female
      1 | Hilliard, Mr. Herbert Hen.. | male
      3 | Kink-Heilmann, Mr. Anton    | male
      2 | Rogers, Mr. Reginald Harr.. | male
```

```
select pclass, sex, count(*) from passengers group by pclass, sex;
```

```
 pclass |  sex   | count 
--------+--------+-------
      3 | male   |   493
      1 | male   |   179
      2 | male   |   171
      3 | female |   216
      1 | female |   144
      2 | female |   106
```


`@script`
Lets say we have a table with the list of passengers from the ship Titanic, and we want to look at the number of male and female passengers in each socio economic class. We could do that by writing a group by statement with the columns Pclass and Sex.
